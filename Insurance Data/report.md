I have worked on loading, profiling, and visualizing insurance data in Power BI, focusing on interactive reporting and insightful dashboards. Key learnings include creating slicers, multi-row cards, ribbon charts, bar and line charts, donut charts, and a matrix visual.

This image shows the raw insurance dataset, which includes customer details, policy numbers, coverage amounts, claim statuses, and policy dates. Here, I learned to perform data profiling, ensuring clean and structured data before visualization.

**Interactive Dashboard for Insurance Data**
This Power BI dashboard summarizes key insights from the insurance dataset. It includes:
- Premium & Coverage Amounts for different policy types.
- Active vs. Inactive Policy Distribution (Pie Chart).
- Number of Claims by Status (Rejected, Settled, Pending) (Bar Chart).
- Claim Amount by Age Group (Line Chart).

I gained hands-on experience in data visualization, interactive filtering with slicers, and structuring dashboards for effective storytelling.
