I explored key Power BI functionalities, including data loading, profiling, slicer formatting, visualization, and report publishing. I customized slicers, added an Age Group column, and created interactive visualizations like a line chart and matrix visual. I also implemented conditional formatting, slicer syncing, and bookmarks to enhance usability.

**Line Chart - Monthly Transaction Trends **

This line chart tracks monthly transactions, showing peaks and dips. It improved my understanding of time-series visualization, interactive filtering, and data storytelling.
